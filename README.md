# Data Augmentation Techniques
Data Augmentation Techniques with Keras, Opencv and Imgaug

In this short tutorial, I briefly explained data augmentation techniques. 
I used imgaug, opencv and keras libraries. 

Collecting more data is a tedious and expensive process. If you can’t do it, you should try to make your data appear as if it was more diverse. To do that, use data augmentation techniques so that each time a sample is processed by the model, it’s slightly different from the previous time. This will make it harder for the model to learn parameters for each sample.
